##Running and using the Real Estate Investment Analysis Dashboard: 
###The charts:
With each chart you can hover over the bars (bar graph), lines (line chart), dot/spots (scatter plot) to see the specific details such as exact dates and amounts.
The side of the graphs have a variety of buttons that do various functions such as, save the chart as a picture, scroll up and down the graph and refresh etc.

###Number of Dwellings Per Year Bar Chart
The first bar chart 'Number of Dwelling Types Per Year', shows the amount of dwelling types per year. 
Each year can be navigated via the tab (at the top of the panel) labeled with the corresponding year.

###Average Monthly Shelter Cost for Owned Dwellings in Toronto
This line graph is simular showing the rented compared to the owned dwellings (you can swap between the two using the tab similar to referenced above).

###Average House Value
This line chart is shown immediately bellow, and shows the average house values per year in Toronto.

###Neighbourhood Average Value and Number of Dwellings.
The line chart shows average house value per neighbourhood throughout 2001-2016 and the bar graph shows the amount of dwelling types per neighbourhood per year.
For both the charts each neighbourhood can be selected via the dropdown 'neighbourhood' button to the right of the corresponding graph.

###and Most Expensive Neighbourhoods by House Value
This is just a simple bar chart.

###Average for each year
This is a table/dataframe I added just to show each years average house value (and to also see how dataframes and tables look and work within a dashboard)
(I chose it because it was a small table and didn't take up too much space)

###Average House Value By Neighbourhood (MAP)
This is a interactive scatter plot over a real map, scroll too zoom in on locations, 
the color of the dots represent each type, or in this case, each neighbourhood, the size of the dots reflect the amount and 
the location represents the location the data is referring to.
